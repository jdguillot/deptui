# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

A Rust + ratatui terminal UI that wraps [serokell/deploy-rs](https://github.com/serokell/deploy-rs).
It does not reimplement deploy-rs — it shells out to the `deploy` binary
and to `nix` / `ssh`. The repo is small enough to keep flat under `src/`.

## Common commands

All of these assume you're inside the dev shell (`nix develop`) so that
`cargo`, `rustc`, `deploy`, `nix`, and `ssh` are on `PATH`.

| task                  | command                                       |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| dev shell             | `nix develop`                                 |
| build                 | `cargo build`                                 |
| release build         | `cargo build --release`                       |
| run against a flake   | `cargo run -- /path/to/flake`                 |
| run against cwd       | `cargo run`                                   |
| lint                  | `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`   |
| format                | `cargo fmt`                                   |
| nix build             | `nix build`                                   |

| test (all)            | `cargo test`                                  |
| test (unit only)      | `cargo test --lib`                             |
| test (integration)    | `cargo test --test '*'`                        |

### Test suite

**Unit tests** (`cargo test --lib`, ~80 tests) live inside `#[cfg(test)]`
blocks in the source modules:

- `ssh.rs` — `SshOverride` accessors, `ssh_args`, `deploy_ssh_opts`,
  `summary`.
- `host.rs` — `split_name_version`, `parsed_paths_equivalent`,
  `compute_version_diff`, `bucket_paths_by_name`, `join_versions`,
  `parse_closure_size`, `build_ssh_target`.
- `deploy.rs` — `strip_ansi`, `ProfileSel::target_suffix`,
  `DeployRequest::target`, `Toggles::default`.
- `flake.rs` — `Node::has_system`, `Node::has_home`, JSON deserialisation.
- `app.rs` — `App::new` defaults, key handling (quit confirmation,
  navigation, toggles, mode selection, help popup, global search
  navigation), `push_log` cap, override management, `FocusPane`
  layout rows.

**Integration tests** (`tests/`, ~12 tests) exercise the process-spawning
code paths via shell-script PATH shims (no real `nix`/`deploy`/`ssh`
required):

- `tests/flake_discover.rs` — mock `nix` binary returns canned JSON;
  covers success, empty nodes, eval failure, and malformed JSON.
- `tests/deploy_run.rs` — mock `deploy` binary; covers stdout/stderr
  streaming, exit code propagation, mode flags (`--boot`,
  `--dry-activate`), toggle flags, SSH override flags, ANSI stripping,
  and profile suffix in the target string.

Integration tests use `serial_test` to serialize because they mutate the
process-global `$PATH`. When adding more, follow the same pattern:
install a shim, mark `#[serial]`, keep the `TempDir` alive for the test
duration.

## Architecture

The flow is `flake → nodes → status → user action → deploy`.

Key invariants worth knowing before touching the code:

- **`flake::discover` is shallow on purpose.** It applies a Nix function
  that strips `path` from each profile, so we don't force evaluation of
  every NixOS module just to draw the host list. If you add a field to
  `Node`/`Profile`, also add it to the `--apply` expression in
  `flake.rs`.
- **`host::check_online` is the only "always-on" background work.** It
  runs once at startup and again on every `r` keypress. The `r` keypress
  also re-runs `flake::discover` so newly-added nodes in the flake appear
  without restarting. Everything more expensive (`u`, deploy itself) is
  lazy and user-triggered.
- **`host::check_profile_up_to_date` resolves the deploy-rs wrapper
  to its toplevel** before comparing against the remote's
  `/run/current-system`. Stripping `/activate` alone isn't enough —
  that yields the activation *wrapper* (e.g.
  `…-nixos-system-<host>-…-activate-path`), whose store hash differs
  from the toplevel (`…-nixos-system-<host>-…`) the remote symlink
  actually points at. The wrapper's direct references include the
  toplevel; `resolve_local_toplevel_quiet` picks it out by parsed
  name match. The fallback `parsed_paths_equivalent` compares
  `<name, version>` pairs when the wrapper isn't in the local store.
- **`app::App::run` is one `tokio::select!`** over three sources: term
  events, background status updates, and live deploy log lines. The
  optional deploy receiver is handled with `recv_optional`, which yields
  a never-resolving future when the receiver is `None` so the `select!`
  arm just stays pending. Tick events skip the draw pass when
  `has_inflight_work()` is false (no spinners to animate), so idle CPU
  is near zero.
- **The deploy log is the only mutable buffer that grows.** It's capped
  at 2000 lines in `App::push_log`. If you add other long-lived buffers,
  cap them too.
- **Modes map directly to deploy-rs flags:**
  `Switch` → no flag, `Boot` → `--boot`, `DryRun` → `--dry-activate`.
  Don't try to emulate `Boot` by SSH-ing manually — deploy-rs already
  supports it.
- **Toggles only emit a flag when they differ from the deploy-rs
  default.** This is on purpose: the flake's `deploy.nodes` settings
  stay authoritative until the user actively flips a switch. If you add
  a toggle, decide its default to match deploy-rs and follow the same
  "only-emit-if-changed" rule in `deploy::run_inner`.
- **`SshOverride` is the single source of truth** for both status
  checks (`host::ssh_capture`) and the deploy runner. If you add a new
  field, update *both* `ssh_args()` (per-token argv for ssh) and
  `deploy_ssh_opts()` (joined string for `--ssh-opts`).
- **The host-list `[ssh]` marker is driven by `SshOverride::is_active`.**
  When clearing the last field of an override, also remove the entry
  from `App.overrides` so the marker disappears — this is what
  `handle_key_edit_override` does.
- **App input mode is a state machine, not just a flag.** Key dispatch
  in `app::App::handle_key` first short-circuits Ctrl-C and the help
  popup, then routes by `InputMode`. Adding a new modal mode means
  adding a new variant *and* a new dispatch arm.
- **Quitting requires confirmation.** Both `q` and `Ctrl-C` enter
  `InputMode::ConfirmQuit` instead of setting `should_quit` directly.
  The popup warns when a deploy is running. Pressing `y`/Enter confirms,
  `n`/Esc cancels. A second `Ctrl-C` while the popup is showing
  confirms immediately (the short-circuit at the top of `handle_key`).
- **`kill_on_drop(true)`** is set on the spawned `deploy` Command so
  cancelling (key `x`) actually reaps the child instead of orphaning
  it. Don't remove it.
- **`NO_COLOR=1`** is set on the spawned `deploy` so its output stays
  legible when forwarded line-by-line into ratatui. Additionally,
  `deploy.rs::strip_ansi` removes any ANSI escape sequences (CSI, OSC,
  bare ESC, control bytes) that leak through from nested `nix`/`ssh`
  children — without this, ratatui's width accounting drifts and
  characters get dropped from the visible text.
- **`Shift+U` chains size + package diff.** There is no separate `p`
  keybind. When a `SizeProbe` Ok arrives in `apply_status`, it
  auto-triggers `spawn_pkg_diff_for_profile` for the same
  `(node, profile)`. This keeps the details pane populated in one
  gesture.
- **Extras (size, pkg_diff) are cleared** both when `u` re-runs (in
  `apply_status` → `UpdateProbe` Ok) and when a deploy succeeds (the
  `LogLine::Exit` handler resets `ProfileExtra` to default). This
  prevents stale numbers from lingering after the closure changes.
- **Content-only change detection.** When `check_package_diff` finds no
  name+version differences but the store-path sets still diverge, it
  emits a `(content-only) N path(s) differ` summary line plus sample
  basenames. The UI detects the `(content-only)` prefix and renders a
  yellow "packages identical, content differs" badge instead of the
  misleading green "packages identical".
- **Scroll clamping happens before the title chip reads it.** `draw_job_log`
  computes inner dimensions and runs `compute_tail_scroll_offset` (which
  clamps in place) before constructing the `[↑N]` chip. This prevents a
  one-frame flash of a stale value when holding `k` past the top.
  (`draw_details` no longer has a scrollable log.)
- **Search highlight: active match is cyan**, all other matches are
  magenta. `highlight_match` takes a `current_match` (1-based global
  index from `log_search_stats`) and a `&mut match_counter` to
  distinguish the active hit across the entire pane.
- **`/`, `n`/`N`, and `Esc` are global search keys.** The early key
  dispatch in `handle_key_normal` catches `/` (open search), `n`/`N`
  (next/prev match), and `Esc` (clear search) before pane-specific arms
  fire, so search works identically regardless of which pane has focus.
  `SearchTarget::JobLog` is the only remaining search target (the details
  pane no longer has a scrollable log section).
- **Job log is filtered to the active host set.** When any hosts are
  marked (space bar), the job log shows only their entries. With no marks,
  it shows only the selected host's entries. Both `draw_job_log` (ui.rs)
  and `filtered_log_indices_for_job_log` (app.rs) implement the same
  filter — keep them in sync.
- **Layout is 2-column.** Left column (35%) is vertically split: hosts on
  top, details on bottom. Right column (65%) is the job log. The details
  pane holds only the summary + extras; it no longer has a log section.
  Commands/info row is below both columns: commands left (60%), info right
  (40%).
- **`--interactive-sudo true` will hang the TUI**, by design — the
  child reads from `Stdio::null()`. Toggle 5 is exposed for
  completeness; the help popup tells the user to press `x` to recover.

## Project conventions

- The project shells out heavily. Treat `nix`, `deploy`, and `ssh` as
  load-bearing dependencies — every code path that touches them should
  surface stderr to the user, not swallow it.
- Errors that originate from external tools should be wrapped with
  `anyhow::Context` describing *what we were doing*, not *what tool we
  ran* (e.g. `discovering deploy.nodes`, not `running nix eval`).
- Don't print to stdout/stderr from the main thread once the TUI is up
  — it will corrupt the alternate screen. Use `--log-file` and tracing
  if you need diagnostics.
- The host badges (`sys:✓` / `sys:↑` / `sys:—` / `sys:!` / `sys:?` / `sys:-`) and
  the colors are part of the user-facing contract — see README. Keep
  them consistent if you change rendering.
